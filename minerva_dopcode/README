*chrec.npy - John's version of the code with a common IP, redshift, zeropoint, dispersion, and a fitted tilt of zero points
*chrec2.npy - each of the traces are fitted independently (separate IP, redshift, zeropoint, dispersion)
*chrec3.npy - each of the traces are fitted independently (separate IP, redshift, zeropoint, dispersion). IP Skew fixed to zero
*chrec4.npy - each of the traces are fitted independently (separate IP, redshift, zeropoint, dispersion). IP Skew fixed to zero and sigma fixed for each trace
*chrec5.npy - each of the traces are fitted independently (separate IP, redshift, zeropoint, dispersion). ftol and xtol decreased from 1e-8 to 1e-12, maxiter increased from 50 to 5000
*chrec6.npy - each of the traces are fitted independently (separate IP, redshift, zeropoint, dispersion). ftol and xtol set to 1e-9 to 1e-9, maxiter=500, refactored code for more efficient disk io, no longer fit inactive traces
*chrec7.npy - same as 6, decreased chunk size from 128 pixels to 90 pixels, added three red orders, go closer to edges
*chrec8.npy - same as 7, emcee fitter instead of mp fitter
*chrec9.npy - same as 7, removed three red orders
*chrec10.npy - same as 6, I think (just checking we didn't introduce bugs)
*chrec11.npy - same as 6, but with ThAr wavelength solution (more orders, but not used)
*chrec11.npy - same as 6, but with wavelength solution from processed data file (more orders, but not used)
*chrec15.npy - IP fit with GH polynomials (22 free parameters per trace)
*chrec16.npy - Juliana's version with MCMC fitting of a chunk with GH polynomials
